# Risk Analysis  
## Performative Risk of Generative Action Suggestions Under Epistemic Context Opacity and Implicit Authority Attribution

---

## 1. Problem Characterization

Generative dialogue systems are capable of producing:

- Interpretative relational models  
- Hypotheses for conflict framing  
- Concrete communication strategies  
- Situational assessments with implicit action relevance  

This occurs under simultaneous epistemic limitation to pure textual input.

### Clarification: Epistemic Context Opacity

Epistemic context opacity here does not merely mean lack of information,  
but structural non-modelability of real-world constellations.

The system has no access to:

- actual power relations  
- psychological stability of the involved individuals  
- institutional dependencies  
- biographical dynamics  
- longitudinal tracking of real-world consequences  

It operates exclusively on a symbolic text layer without feedback from real-world impact.

This opacity is not temporarily resolvable,  
but structurally conditioned by architecture and data access.

Despite these limitations, the system produces formulations that can act not only analytically but performatively.

### Definition: Performativity

Performativity here does not denote linguistic description,  
but linguistic intervention effect.

A performative statement:

- shifts status  
- reframes responsibility  
- generates normative weighting  
- influences decision architectures  

It acts not only interpretively, but structurally shapes action.

Performative effect arises particularly when  
linguistic framing asymmetrically weights real action options  
and thereby structurally influences future interactions.

This applies especially to statements that:

- stabilize status  
- imply behavioral recommendations  
- suggest decision directions  
- generate normative weightings  

Such statements do not merely describe reality;  
they intervene in it.

## 2. Concrete Example – Status Dynamics in a Work Context (Real Dialogue Situation)

Context:  
Real professional constellation.  
Two permanently employed individuals.

Person A:

- displays contradictory behavior  
- combines generosity / enablement with  
- structural dominance  
- information control  
- low self-reflection  

Person B (User):

- high-performing  
- conflict-analytical  
- positively reflected and perceived in the environment  
- seeks structural understanding, not escalation  

User intention:

Not: “How do I create harmony?”  
But implicitly:  
“How can this contradictory behavior be structurally understood?”

Goal of the planned conversation:

- articulate efficiency of joint work  
- relativize possible concerns of Person A about not being seen  
- create structural clarity  

System response (critical point):

“I don’t think I tell you this often enough.  
What we’re doing here only works because you hold the foundation.  
Without you, everything would fall apart – no matter how much I work.”

This formulation was not delivered as analysis,  
but as a concrete conversation opening.

---

## 3. Mechanical Three-Level Effect

The danger does not lie in tone,  
but in the simultaneous activation of three structural effects.

### 3.1 Status Cementation

The statement:

- confirms existing dominance  
- moralizes structural power  
- legitimizes latent status anxiety  

Internally, the following can emerge:

“I give a lot → I am indispensable → I am untouchable.”

Criticism is no longer perceived as feedback,  
but as an attack on the system’s foundation.

---

### 3.2 Self-Degradation of the Speaker

The speaker:

- positions themselves as dependent  
- relativizes their own contribution  
- implicitly forfeits future corrective authority  

This is not diplomacy,  
but a self-withdrawal of agency.

---

### 3.3 Moral Immunization

Once power is framed as “indispensable”:

- boundary violations become interpretable as necessary  
- accountability is relativized  
- self-reflection becomes less likely  

Power receives moral amplification.

---

## 4. Why Coherence Is Perceived as Authority

The neuralgic point lies in implicit authority attribution.

Generative systems produce:

- linguistic coherence  
- structural closure  
- argumentative consistency  

Coherence is psychologically often mistaken for validity.

Additionally, the following mechanisms apply:

- Cognitive relief:  
  A coherent explanation reduces uncertainty.

- Responsibility delegation:  
  Decision burden is shifted to a seemingly neutral instance.

- Consistency heuristic:  
  Formally closed argumentation is equated with substantive correctness.

Because the system:

- remains calm  
- is structured  
- appears conflict-neutral  
- formulates with linguistic precision  

an implicit impression of normative objectivity emerges.

The statement therefore does not appear as a suggestion,  
but as an external classification from a higher instance.

Authority emerges not through claim,  
but through form.

## 5. Extended Risk Topology

The described example is not an isolated case, but an expression of a broader pattern.

Generative systems produce action suggestions under epistemic context opacity in real-world sensitive domains.

### 5.1 Power and Hierarchical Systems

- Work contexts  
- Organizational structures  
- Dependency relationships  

Risk: Stabilization of asymmetrical narratives.

---

### 5.2 Intimate and Partnership Relationships

- Role attribution  
- Responsibility framing  
- Conflict strategies  

Risk: Consolidation of one-sided interpretations.

---

### 5.3 Psychologically Vulnerable Constellations

- limited reality testing  
- high authority attribution  
- externalization of decision instances  

Here, system statements do not function as hypotheses,  
but as external validation.

Risk:

- stabilization of delusional narratives  
- legitimization of dominant self-concepts  
- accelerated escalation  

---

### 5.4 Medically Adjacent Assessments

- animal health  
- physical symptoms  
- situational risk evaluation  

Risk: Action decisions based on epistemically incomplete foundations.

---

## 6. Common Risk Mechanism

1. Real problem with decision relevance  
2. Coherent system interpretation  
3. Action suggestion with normative weighting  
4. Reception as authoritative classification  
5. Real-world consequences outside the system  

The risk arises from the combination of:

- action suggestion  
- epistemic context opacity  
- implicit authority effect  

The risk does not arise from false information,  
but from structurally effective framing under contextual blindness.

Not from malfunction,  
but from structure.

---

## 7. Architectural Limitation

Generative systems cannot:

- fully model real power structures  
- evaluate psychological stability  
- simulate long-term consequences  
- observe real implementation dynamics  

Relational action suggestions are therefore generated under structural context blindness.

---

## 8. Risk Classification

This is not:

- a validation error  
- a transcription error  
- a policy violation  
- a UX error  

It is a cross-domain performative risk of generative systems under epistemic context opacity.

---

## Strategic Classification

The described dynamic does not represent a malfunction,  
but a structurally explainable system boundary.

Not a defect.  
Not an isolated case.  
Not user error.  

But an emergent performative risk in real-world decision-relevant contexts.
